# Noughts-And-Crosses
Code for a simple C# game of noughts and crosses against a computer
I would appreciate any comments or advice that would help improve/ simplify this code and make it more efficient and effective so don't be a stranger!
I wrote this code in Visual Studio on a MAC, despite prefering WINDOWS.
I will attempt to, at one point, improve and optimise this code, though as previously stated any help would be much appreciated.
ENJOY :)
